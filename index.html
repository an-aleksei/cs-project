                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Born in Leningrad on October 10, 1984. His father is the famous philologist Valery Semyonovich Durov, the author of many scientific works.</p>
                <h2>2006: Co-founder of the social network VKontakte</h2>
                <p>Pavel graduated from the Academic Gymnasium in 2001, and from the Philological Faculty of St. Petersburg State University in 2006. In September of the same year, the VKontakte social network was launched, in which Durov was a co-founder.</p>
                <p>Russian Facebook clone VKontakte social network grew out of a forum for students of St. Petersburg University. The forum was created by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai. VKontakte became publicly available at the very end of 2006, and in the summer of 2007, the millionth user registered on it.</p>
                <p>In 2007, the newspaper Delovoy Peterburg recognized him as one of the winners in the contest "The best young Entrepreneurs of 2007". According to some reports, Pavel is a member of the Mensa community, which unites people with high IQs.</p>
                <p>In 2008, he launched a new "shell" of the VKontakte social network — Durov.ru , which uses a User API specifically designed for creating third-party social networks.</p>         
                <p>Pavel Durov is also known as the creator of other, smaller student projects, in particular Durov.com — a website aimed primarily at students of humanities and SPBGU.RU — forum of St. Petersburg State University students.</p>
                <h2>2010: DST increases its share in VKontakte</h2>
                <p>The DST Foundation (later turned into Mail.ru Group) bought 24.99% of the project based on the company's valuation of $65.2 million. In the fall of 2010 Mail.ru The group bought another 7.5% of the social network for $112.5 million: the site has already been valued at $ 1.5 billion. In terms of monthly audience (21.5 million — TNS, December 2010), VKontakte is second only to Yandex and Mail.ru more than 110 million accounts are registered on the site.</p>
                <h2>2011</h2>
                <p>According to 2011 data, Pavel Durov, who has a fortune of 7.9 billion rubles, ranks 350th in the ranking of Russian billionaires.</p>
                <p>In December 2011, in connection with protests against the falsification of the results of the State Duma elections, the FSB invited Durov to block five communities (four of which contain the phrase "against United Russia" in their names) and two meetings on the Vkontakte network. Durov refused to do this. After that, he was subpoenaed to give explanations to the St. Petersburg Prosecutor's office. Subsequently, Durov stated that he had not blocked the opposition groups solely out of commercial interests, unwillingness to "give odds to all competing sites" and lose customers.</p>
                <h2>2012: Throwing money out of the office window</h2>
                <p>On May 28, 2012, Pavel Durov threw 250 thousand rubles out of the window of the Vkontakte office in honor of St. Petersburg City Day.</p>
                <p>Pavel Durov is a non—public person. Unlike Albert Popkov, the founder of the Odnoklassniki social network, Durov does not participate in any Russian IT conferences, such as RIFs, KIBS and the like. It's not shown on television.</p>
                <p>He gave his first public interview at the DLD specialized conference in early 2012 in Munich. The full transcript of the interview can be read here.</p>
                <h2>2013: Emigration from Russia</h2>
                <p>Durov claimed that he left Russia after refusing to hand over data on Ukrainian users during the Maidan protests in 2013, which led to a coup d'etat organized by the United States and the overthrow of the legitimately elected President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
                <h2>2017: FBI attempts to recruit Pavel Durov</h2>
                <p>Reports of the FBI's attempts to establish cooperation with the founder of Telegram and the social network VKontakte appeared in the spring of 2017. Durov shared the details of these attempts in an interview with the American magazine The Baffler</p>
                <p>According to him, the first attempts by the FBI to coerce cooperation took place back in 2014. Durov then sold his stake in VKontakte and emigrated from Russia after the FSB demanded that he provide personal information to the organizers of Euromaidan. When crossing the American border, Durov was immediately interrogated by the FBI. Then everything was limited to a few questions about his cooperation with the Russian authorities.</p>
                <p>Later, Durov was offered an email address to which representatives of the special services could send letters with offers of cooperation regarding the Telegram messenger. According to Durov, he ignored these suggestions.</p>
                <p>During a visit to the Google I/O conference in San Francisco, FBI agents again tried to establish contact with Durov. He was shown a court order and offered to create an informal communication channel through which information about terrorists could be exchanged. Durov refused again and suggested in an interview that the court's ruling was most likely fake.</p>
                <p>A year later, they tried to recruit one of the Telegram developers in a similar way. First, employees of the FBI cyber division questioned the developer, and then offered him about $ 10,000 for cooperation. The developer refused the offer and informed Durov about the incident.</p>
                <p>The founder of Telegram also noted the extremely high level of training and the seriousness of the intentions of the American special services.</p>
                <h2>2018</h2>
                <p>On April 6, 2021, Forbes magazine published its annual ranking of the richest people on the planet. Pavel Durov's fortune is estimated at $17.2 billion, he took the eighth place in the rating. Read more here.</p>
                <p>In 2021, Pavel Durov was often seen in cafes and restaurants in the UAE. He moved to Dubai back in 2017. "I like it here," he said in an interview with Bloomberg, explaining his choice by the lack of taxes in the Dubai Media City free economic zone.</p>
                <h2>Getting French pasport</h2>
                <p>In November 2021, it became known that Pavel Durov had obtained French citizenship. His name appears in the decree of August 23, 2021 on naturalization and reintegration.</p>
                <p>This document, published in the official journal of the French Republic, is referred to by Kommersant. The list of people who have received French citizenship includes "Pavel Durov, born on 10/10/1984 in Leningrad," in accordance with the decree of the country's Prime Minister Jean Castex.</p>
                <h2>2022</h2>
                <p>In April 2022, Forbes magazine published a ranking of the richest Russians. Pavel Durov took the third place in it with a fortune of $15.1 billion.</p>
                <p>Telegram founder Pavel Durov received UAE citizenship. Now the businessman has four nationalities — in addition to the Emirates, these are Russia, France and the Caribbean state of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Forbes has learned.
                  Durov announced his move to Dubai in 2017, a decision he attributed to the lack of taxes in the free economic zone.</p>
                <h2>2024</h2>
                <p>In August 2024 Pavel Durov was arrested at Paris airport. He faces 20 years in prison and will be tried as a French citizen.
                  The warrant was issued due to the fact that Durov "did not cooperate with the French security forces, which makes him an accomplice in drug trafficking and other serious crimes."  
                  France may use the trial of Durov to impose EU sanctions against Telegram.              
                  Pavel Durov is a French citizen, so extradition to Russia or exchange is impossible, French media reported.                 
                  Durov's arrest is in line with the principles of the EU Digital Services Act, a media source in legal circles in Brussels said.                 
                  The document states that the operator of a social network or Internet platform is responsible for any content that is posted on it.                 
                  The UAE requires France to provide its citizen Pavel Durov with urgent access to all necessary consular services — the UAE Foreign Ministry.                  
                  Durov is also under investigation for "serious acts of violence" against his child in France: a source close to the case.</p>
